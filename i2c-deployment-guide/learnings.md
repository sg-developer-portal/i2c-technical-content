## Key Learning and Findings

- The CRTS toolsets can cover 80% of AWS resources with some unsupported resources that couldn’t be converted due to limitations, however those unsupported resources are mainly PAAS services, like Amplify, Elastic Beanstalk, hence it doesn’t impact POC outcome as our objectives are to convert IAAS services.
- We discovered that codes generated by CRTS contain hard-coded values within, hence key learning is to improvise the codes by parameterization to replace hard-coded values so that codes can be portable for re-use in other projects or for other AWS accounts. 
- POC was conducted in a standalone machine without problem, but If agency has a team working on IaC initiative collaboratively, to avoid codes/files been overwritten, the best is to check in all codes/file in Version Control System (VCS) for “single source of truth” and for better control with versioning for traceability of code changes.
- We found that Terraformer has an undocumented bug: if we try to convert EC2 and EBS resources together, the conversion process will terminate unexpectedly. Hence, we have to convert EC2 and EBS one-by-one to avoid this issue.
