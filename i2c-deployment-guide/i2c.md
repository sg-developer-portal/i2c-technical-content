## Solution Overview

I<sub>2</sub>C (Infra to Code), formerly known as “Cloud Resource Transformation Solution (CRTS)”, is the Application Programming Interface (API) based solution to allow import of existing cloud infrastructure resources for applications into Terraform files and state files organized as directories on S3 buckets. User can subsequently manage and maintain the cloud resources programmatically, thus reducing human errors and increase speed to change. Architecture diagram is depicted below. The solution is based on serverless and cloud-native, including components such as AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS Batch, AWS Fargate, Amazon S3, Terraform, CheckOV and lastly Terraformer (key component).

**NOTE: CRTS** or **crts** will still be used in most part of the document, so as not to disturb the existing code.
